This is a demo of using the iioEngine JavaScript framework to fill the browser with a bunch of "angry birds" flying around and bouncing :-)

Ok, not very impressive, but very simple to check, review and understad the code.

Check out the iioEngine framework! http://iioengine.com/

You can open "FlyingBirds.html" in a browser and see what happens, or you can simply view the demo video here: https://vimeo.com/86889972
